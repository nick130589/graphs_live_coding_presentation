========

This is the project where you can train you algorithmic skills in:
- bfs (Breadth first search)
- dfs (Depth first search)
- djus (DisJoint Union of Sets)

Test cases are created for:
- ![Cyclic undirected](graphs_pictures/Cyclic%20undirected.png "Cyclic undirected") 
- ![Tree](graphs_pictures/Tree.png "Tree")
- ![With multi-edge](graphs_pictures/With%20multi-edge.png "With multi-edge")
- ![With Loops](graphs_pictures/With%20Loops.png "With Loops")
- ![Directed](graphs_pictures/Directed.png "Directed")
- ![Multiple connected component](graphs_pictures/Multiple%20connected%20component.png "Multiple connected component")
- ![Forest](graphs_pictures/Forest.png "Forest")
- ![Single vertex ](graphs_pictures/Single%20vertex.png "Single vertex")
- ![Single vertex with Loop ](graphs_pictures/Single%20vertex%20with%20Loop.png "Single vertex with Loop")

Check out and code branch: `master`

Solution branch: `solution`
